## Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version >= 8.9 or above (which can be checked by running `node -v`). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing multiple Node versions on a single machine installed
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running `yarn version`). Yarn is a performant package manager for JavaScript and replaces the `npm` client. It is not strictly necessary but highly encouraged.

# Adding Content

## Adding a new docs page to an existing sidebar

1. Create the doc as a new markdown file in `/docs`, example `docs/newly-created-doc.md`:

```md
---
id: newly-created-doc
title: This Doc Needs To Be Edited
---

My new content here..
```

1. Refer to that doc's ID in an existing sidebar in `website/sidebar.json`:

```javascript
// Add newly-created-doc to the Getting Started category of docs
{
  "docs": {
    "Getting Started": [
      "quick-start",
      "newly-created-doc" // new doc here
    ],
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```
