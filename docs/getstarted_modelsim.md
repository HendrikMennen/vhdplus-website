In order to not always have to compile and program the code and help with finding errors, you can simulate your program. 
You have to set the inputs of Main or a Component and after running the simulation, you can see how the values of all signals 
change while running the code. This way, you have a lot of information to compare at a glance, which helps to find the error or 
check if your code works as expected more easily.
