# Coming Soon

## VHDPlus Core MAX10

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/component_vhdpcore_max10">
      <Image src='/img/vhdpcore/max10_img.jpg'/>
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    The VHDPlus Core MAX10 is the entry into FPGA programming. With it's many I/Os, internal ADC, large RAM, Flash and an onboard USB programmer, you can even realize complex projects with many components and an internal Arduino-compatible processor that work together.

## VHDPlus Shield MAX10

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/components_shield">
      <video width="400" muted autoPlay loop><source src="/img/vhdpshield/Shield.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>Your browser does not support the video tag. You can download the video anyway.</video>
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    The shield for the Core MAX10 features a powersupply, so you can power the board with a battery or power adapter, and more CRUVI connectors, so you can connect camera, motors and ultrasonic sensors at once while you're powering the FPGA with the same supply as the motors.
  </Box>

## VHDPlus Camera Extension

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/components_camera">
      <Image src='/img/extensions/cam/Camera_Con.png'/>
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    The Camera and Display extension allows to program your own object detection, make your own safety camera and much more. 
    It supports state of the art CSI cameras like the Raspberry Pi Camera and standard HDMI, so you don't have to mess with outdated standards and get the best image quality.

## VHDPlus Motor Extension

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/components_motor">
      <Image src='/img/extensions/dcmotor/Motor_2.png'/>
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    The Motor and Encoder extension is the first step for your own robot. It supports most of the motors you can buy and allows to connect an encoder, so you can profit from the FPGA and keep track of the current speed and driven distance.
  </Box>

## VHDPlus Level Shifter Extension

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/components_levelshifter">
      <video width="400" muted autoPlay><source src="/img/extensions/levelshifter/Zoom.mp4" type="video/mp4"/>Your browser does not support the video tag. You can download the video anyway.</video>
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    The Level Shifter extension allows you to connect hardware with 5V IO voltage like ultrasonic sensors or an LED matrix. It can be used in many projects and hardware for arduinos can be connected.
  </Box>

## VHDPlus Audio Extension

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/components_audio">
      <Image src='/img/extensions/CRUVILS.webp'/>
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    The Audio extension features an Audio Codec IC that allows to receive and output analog audio data. This allows you to e.g. make your own audio mixer, synthesizer or program a voice recognition. Like for image processing, you also profit from FPGAs with audio processing.
  </Box>

# Coming Later

## VHDPlus Core MAX10 Ultra

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <Image src='/img/vhdpcore/max10_bw.jpg'/>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    The VHDPlus Core MAX10 Ultra comes in the same package as the usual Core MAX10, but with 2x the Logic Elemtents, 50% more RAM, 4 instead of 2 PLLs and more advantages. If you mastered your first projects and want to make even bigger ones, this is the board for you.
  </Box>

## VHDPlus Core C5

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <Image src='/img/vhdpcore/max10_bw.jpg'/>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    The VHDPlus Core C5 is way different than the Core MAX10. It features 5x the logic elements of the Core MAX10, 10x more RAM and even a dedicated 800MHz Dual-ARM-Cortex-A9 Core in the FPGA chip. This allows you to combine a high speed processor with your custom hardware on the FPGA for e.g. complex roboters with object detection and multiple sensors or a game console.
