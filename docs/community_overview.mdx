## Example Projects with Tutorial

## Smart Route Following Robot

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/community_motor">
      <video width="400" muted autoPlay loop><source src="/img/community/robot-demonstration.webm" type="video/webm"/>Your browser does not support the video tag. You can download the video anyway.</video>
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    In this tutorial: We want to make a robot that can drive a pre defined route and surround objects blocking the route. <br/><br/>
    What you need: Motors with encoder, ultrasonic sensors and something you want to use as casing.
  </Box>
</Flex>
<br/>
<hr/>

## Camera with Object Detection

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/community_camera">
      <img src="/img/community/object_detect.gif" width="400" />
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    In this tutorial: You learn how to use a camera and HDMI with an FPGA. <br/>
    You learn how to apply filters to the received images and finaly create an object detection. <br/><br/>
    What you need: Raspberry Pi camera and display with HDMI
  </Box>
</Flex>
<br/>
<hr/>

## LED Matrix

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/community_matrix">
      <video width="400" muted autoPlay loop><source src="/img/community/matrix-demonstration.webm" type="video/webm"/>Your browser does not support the video tag. You can download the video anyway.</video>
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    In this tutorial: We want to make an LED matrix that can display a custom text or show an image. 
    This can be extended into a clock, games or a spectrum analyzer.<br/><br/>
    What you need: LED Matrix
  </Box>
</Flex>
<br/>
<hr/>

## Spectrum Analyzer

<Flex flexWrap='wrap' mx={-2}>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 1/3 ]}>
    <a href="/docs/community_spectrum">
      <video width="400" muted autoPlay loop><source src="/img/community/spectrum-demonstration.webm" type="video/webm"/>Your browser does not support the video tag. You can download the video anyway.</video>
    </a>
  </Box>
  <Box p={2} width={[ 1, 2/3 ]}>
    In this tutorial: We want to use a microphone to record the ambient sound and then filter the different frequencies out of the sound.
    This is done by a so called "fast Fourier transform", that usually is a complex operation, but quickly made by the FPGA. 
    Finaly we want to display the result with an LED matrix.<br/><br/>
    What you need: LED Matrix and microphone
  </Box>
</Flex>

If you want to see what is possible and what you can achieve, go check out what other people have done so far with VHDPlus.
You can find many more examples [here](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vhdplus).
## Did you make your own project/libraries or found an error in our libraries?
[Our libraries](https://github.com/leonbeier/VHDPlus_Libraries_and_Examples) are open-source, and we would appreciate it if you added your examples or libraries. By adding the libraries we have written for different sensors, hardware... we hope everybody can become faster with their programming. Currently, for FPGAs, it is very difficult to find your needed libraries and when you do find them, you often have to spend money to buy them. We want to change that. <br/>
To add your library, simply make a Github account, fork the repository, add your changes and make a pull request. After this we can add your changes.

## Need help with VHDPlus?
If you have any problems understanding something, try searching on [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/vhdp) for similar problems or create a new one.
You can also ask questions on [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/vhdplus/shared_invite/enQtNzUyNTkzMDA4OTk4LTM4MWI0NzAxZDA4NzNiMDkxZWM4MzViMDQ5NzcxYWI2NTA1MzM2ZDlkNmQ5ZDQ5MzIwM2E4NjZmMGI3MjhhZWE)

### Found an issue in our IDE?
Simply write us at <a href="mailto:info@vhdplus.com">info@vhdplus.com</a><br/>
Send us the `Documents\VHDPlus\CrashReports` file if the IDE has crashed,<br/>copy the VHDP and VHDL file if there was a problem with the compiler and<br/> describe as much as possible what you did before the problem occured, This will help us to fix it as fast as possible.
