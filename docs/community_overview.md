You can find many more examples [here](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=vhdplus).
## Did you make your own project/libraries or found an error in our libraries?
[Our libraries](https://github.com/leonbeier/VHDPlus_Libraries_and_Examples) are open-source, and we would appreciate it if you added your examples or libraries. By adding the libraries we have written for different sensors, hardware... we hope everybody can become faster with their programming. Currently, for FPGAs, it is very difficult to find your needed libraries and when you do find them, you often have to spend money to buy them. We want to change that. <br/>
To add your library, simply make a Github account, fork the repository, add your changes and make a pull request. After this we can add your changes.
