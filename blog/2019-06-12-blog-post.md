We are currently working on a cross platform version of the VHDPlus IDE which was recently windows only.
It will feature a visual studio like docking system, real time error checking, programming suggestions, simulation assist and much more useful features.

## VHDP IDE Preview

We are planning on releasing the first BETA for Windows and Linux soon.

## MAC OS Support
Since the VHDPlus IDE is created with <a href="https://github.com/AvaloniaUI/Avalonia" target="_blank">Avalonia</a>, it could run on MAC OS. But in order to compile and program our boards we rely on <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/programmable/downloads/download-center.html" target="_blank">Quartus</a> from Intel. Sadly, there is no support for MAC OS at the moment.

We could potentially release a version for MAC OS, which would allow programming VHDP and translating to VHDL but not compiling to bitstream.
If you are interested in a restricted MAC OS version of our IDE, please write a mail to <a href="mailto:info@vhdplus.com">info@vhdplus.com</a>
