**Since the built-in updater was broken in the last version for some systems we strongly recommend downloading this update using your browser.**

With update **0.9.1** we are confident that the new compiler is stable enough to be used as default.
We also fixed some issues and improved the overall editor performance.
The built-in updater is much faster now (twice as fast) and should work for all systems without problems.
