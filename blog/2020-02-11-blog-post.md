It has been a few months since our last blog post so I decided to inform you about our current status and plans. Currently we are doing this project unpaid in our free time so please forgive us if some updates take a bit longer than expected. This project is alive and we are getting closer to our first stable release, but we still have some things to do. Our goal is to deliver a clean and stable IDE on all platforms for our first official release üêû.

## Hardware

![VHDP Core MAX10](/img/vhdpcore/max10_img.jpg)
We are currently testing our new development board made by [Trenz Electronics](https://www.trenz-electronic.de/).
More information about this will be released when it's ready :)

## Upcoming IDE Features

### Features we are currently working on
- A new graphical user interface that will help you connect your hardware with your FPGA.
- An Implementation of [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl) for our IDE which will be called GHDP for better simulation.
- Overall stability and performance improvements

### Planned features
- Full Git support similar to Visual Studio Code.

## Documentation & Tutorials

We started to produce a few step-by-step guides that will show you how easy it is to program with VHDPlus and can help you understand how everything works.
They can be found [here](/docs/community_overview).
